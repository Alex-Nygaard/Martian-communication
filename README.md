### Definition of the problem
The problem can be described as follows: 
There are 3 different stations involved, each one being on a different planet/moon in our solar system. One is located on **Earth**, one is located on the **Moon** and the last one is located on **Mars**. The goal of this project is establishing a method of communication between the Earth and Mars. This scenario will be simulated here on campus, between 3 different houses.

The communication method is alse very limited between the 3 different stations. The station on Earth can *only* communicate with the station on the Moon through **morse code**, and the station on the Moon can *only* communicate with the stations on Mars and Earth through **binary code**. Any station can only communicate in their "language". Thus, the station on Mars must communicate back to the Moon through binary too. Also, its important that the station on Earth **can not** communicate with the station on Mars. It must go through the Moon.

A visualization of the flow of information looks like this:

Another challenge is the fact that none of the people involved know morse or binary by heart, meaning all communication has to be translated to and from English, and be received as English as well.

The last requirement of the system is that the input method of English characters to create the message only uses **2 push buttons**. 

To evaluate how successfull our solution is, a series a success criterias must be created. These are as follows:
1. The system has an easy to use user interface on all parts
1. The messages are translated flawslessly between the languages
1. The messages are transmitted flawlessly between the source and receiver
